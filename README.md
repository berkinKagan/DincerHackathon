## 1. Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the Warehouse Management System (WMS) with Image Processing project! This project is designed to help logistic companies manage and optimize their warehouse operations using image processing technology. It uses the Django framework and incorporates an AI model inspired by Meta's "Segment Anything" technology.

Managing a warehouse efficiently is critical for logistics companies, and this project aims to streamline various aspects of warehouse management, including inventory tracking, item recognition, and order fulfilment.

## 2. Features<a name="features"></a>

- **Inventory Management**: Keep track of all items stored in the warehouse, including their quantity, location, and other relevant details.

- **Image Recognition**: Utilize image processing technology to recognize and classify items in real-time, allowing for accurate inventory management and order processing.

- **Order Fulfillment**: Manage customer orders, track their status, and optimize order picking and packing processes.

- **Location Tracking**: Monitor the location of items within the warehouse, making it easier to find and retrieve products.

- **AI-Driven Insights**: The AI model provides valuable insights into inventory trends, helping you make informed decisions about stock levels and warehouse layout.
